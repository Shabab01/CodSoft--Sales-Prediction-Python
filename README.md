# Sales Prediction Using Python

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict sales based on advertising expenditure across different media channels, including TV, Radio, and Newspaper. Using a dataset that includes these expenditures and the corresponding sales figures, we perform exploratory data analysis and build a linear regression model to make sales predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `advertising.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- **TV**: Advertising cost spent on TV (in thousands of dollars)
- **Radio**: Advertising cost spent on Radio (in thousands of dollars)
- **Newspaper**: Advertising cost spent on Newspapers (in thousands of dollars)
- **Sales**: Sales generated (in thousands of units)

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset file (`advertising.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model building.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.

## Libraries and Tools
The following libraries and tools are used in this project:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales. Key insights include:
- TV advertising has the highest average expenditure.
- Newspaper advertising has the lowest average expenditure.
- Sales are highly correlated with TV advertising expenditure.

## Data Visualization
Various plots are used to visualize the data:
- Pair plots to observe relationships between variables.
- Histograms to visualize the distribution of advertising expenditure.
- Heatmaps to visualize the correlation between variables.

## Model Building
We build a linear regression model to predict sales based on TV advertising expenditure:
1. **Data Splitting**: The data is split into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**: A linear regression model is trained using the training set.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set.

## Results
The linear regression model successfully predicts sales with the following equation:
\[ \text{Sales} = \text{Intercept} + \text{Coefficient} \times \text{TV Expenditure} \]

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how advertising expenditure on TV can effectively predict sales. This model can help businesses optimize their advertising budgets to maximize sales.

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-prediction-python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sales-prediction-python
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script for data analysis and model training.
